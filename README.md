# New Architecture Guidelines

If you want to create a new architecture, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Folder:**  
   In the project's root directory, create a new folder with the name of your architecture.  
   For example, if your new architecture is called `new_architecture`, create a folder:  
   ```
   new_architecture
   ```

2. **Add a Python File:**  
   Inside your new folder, create a Python file with the same name as the folder (e.g., `new_architecture.py`). This file will contain your model's training, architecture setup, or any related code.

3. **Create an Empty `__init__.py` File:**  
   In the same folder, add an empty `__init__.py` file. This file designates the folder as a Python package, which helps with proper module imports and project organization.

4. **Training and Evaluation:**  
   After training your model using the new architecture, use the `evaluate.py` script (located in the project root) to evaluate your model's performance. The evaluation should follow a similar pattern as shown in the [`logistic_regression.py`](./logistic_regression/logistic_regression.py) file.

## Example Directory Structure

```
.
├── __init__.py
├── data
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── cleaned_crime_data_stratified.csv
│   ├── ... (other data files)
├── evaluate.py
├── logistic_regression
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── logistic_regression.py
└── new_architecture
    ├── __init__.py
    └── new_architecture.py
```

## Environment Setup and Running Your Architecture

1. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**  
   Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project (e.g., `ML-Project`).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**  
   Create a new virtual environment using the provided `requirements.txt` file. For example, if you are using `venv`, run:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Your File:**  
   Once your environment is set up, run your new architecture file as a module using the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m new_architecture.new_architecture
   ```

By following these guidelines, you ensure that new architectures are seamlessly integrated into the project and that they can be evaluated using the existing `evaluate.py` framework.
